Language and ideas:

  - write up about module/interface.  Review import, export, module, etc.
    See CHANGES.

  - Redesign accessing items from enum types.  Parsing as Enum.item does
    not work, since this would require symboltables during parsing (how to
    distinguish between param.func and Enum.item ?).  Idea: Maybe use a new
    item-operator ::? E.g. Enum::item.

  - structs ?  Contrary to classes do not support inheritance, but provide
    fixed layout.

  - Think about non-gc objects.

  - Think about lazy evaluation (generalize the 'promise' concept
    introduced en passent with sync).  See x10 -> futures.

  - checked exceptions.  Declare as

      def generic f() : 'X
          raises 'B
          reify () : N, () : P
          where B isa Throwable
        ...

    additionally

      def generic f() : 'X
          no-raise
          reify ....

    to document that a function does not let exceptions through.

  - Think about: all objects are passed by value (i.e. even for vectors);
    values passed to spawned functions are actually copied, otherwise
    internal refcounted.  It is possible to explicitely use references:

      def f(a : ^Int, b : ^Vector<Octet>)

    Note this, of course, would require to write all typical oo-functions
    as

      def generic f(self @ ^MyType, ...)

    if the function is to be non-const.

  - Embedding of C/C++ fragments


Documentation

  - Write nested modules section.

  - rewrite exporting, visibility, and importing section

  - Mention explicitely: no coercing.  Where?

  - Write assignment section.

  - Rewrite the "def xxx" to the new deffn-form-example style.



Bootstrap compiler

  Implement last missing pass1 stuff

    - what's about multiple return values?  Spe?  Pass1?  Pass2?

    - pass2:
      - for measures, units, enums,

      - where clauses

      - select

      - match

    - access values from enums as Enum::item

    - extend macro parameter types (like ?a:type-spec)

    - macros

      - subpatterns

  continue with pexpreval (add the missing operators)

  unittests for Rational() class.

  docstrings in pass2 -> extracted documentation
