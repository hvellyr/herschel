Language and ideas:

  Think about non-gc objects.

  Think about lazy evaluation.

  Think about: all objects are passed by value (i.e. even for vectors);

  internal refcounted.  It is possible to explicitely use references:

    def f(a : ^Int, b : ^Vector<Octet>)

  Embedding of C/C++ fragments
