Documentation

  - Write assignment section.

  - Document how to specify class functions:

      def generic apply(self @ Class<Abc>) ... ???

  - Mention explicitely: coercing.  Where?

  - Rewrite the "def xxx" to the new deffn-form-example style.

  - document call-by-value, reference types.

  - rewrite the operator section


Bootstrap compiler

  - support of arrays

  - gc

  - closures (nested functions, firstclass functions)

  - exceptions

  - keyed arguments

  - rest arguments

  - auto create accessor/modifier functions for slots

  - support 'auto', 'public', 'outer', 'inner', slots in ctor construction.

  - review possibilities for warnings about ambiguous multiple method
    dispatch.

  - check that left hand variables are not const.

  - review some kind of auto-number coercion?

  - 'T are treated as Any inside of function body for direct comparison
    and need type-check boundaries at runtime.  The type checker must make
    sure that a 'T is only assigned to 'T and not 'K or 'V.

  - reference types.
     - type checks.  When is T = ^T allowed?
     - do we need a special syntax for dereferencing references?
     - review special construct to check whether a ^T is nil or not?
       if (a as* T == nil)

       def foo(a : ^String)
         let x : String = enforce(a, "a is nil")    ;; throws an exception
         let x : String = saferef(a, "n.n.")        ;; returns a or "n.n."

     - how to express nil-ness with the normal type machine


  - do an error counter and stop after xxx errors.  Generally don't go into
    real compilation, when we found (severe) errors.  LLVM crashes too easily.

  - constraints

  - BUG: syntax errors from import files are not shown (handled) properly.

  - BinaryNode: in case the builtin types are not recognized from the
    compiler, lookup an add(), subtract(), multiply(), ... function and use
    its type signature to check whether the binary operator is possible and
    correct.

    The same for binary compare operators.

    The same for append(), fold()

  - Missing node support:
     - match
     - select
     - on
     - UnitConst

  - replace the UnitConstant node by a proper Measure() ctor call.  Apply
    the unit transformation inplace (if simple enough).  Register
    unit-transform calls as special functions.

  - transform nested functions
    - detect closure variable access

    - detect whether nested functions can simply be inlined

    - otherwise lambda lift functions to outside.

  - array access

  - enum:
    - construct proper enum constraint type
    - check that init values match the base type

  - extend macro parameter types (like ?a:type-spec)

  - macros
    - subpatterns

  - continue with pexpreval (add the missing operators)

Language and ideas:

  - structs ?  Contrary to classes do not support inheritance, but provide
    fixed, controlled, and fast slot layout.  Structs will use the same
    syntax for member access:

    def struct Element {
      def slot a : Int
      def slot b : String
    }

    let e : Element
    e^a = 42
    e^b = "The question"


  - Think about non-gc objects.

  - Think about lazy evaluation (generalize the 'promise' concept
    introduced en passent with sync).  See x10 -> futures.  (cf. doc/CHANGES)

  - checked exceptions.  Declare as

      def generic f() : 'X
          raises 'B
          reify () : N, () : P
          where B isa Throwable
        ...

    additionally

      def generic f() : 'X
          no-raise
          reify ....

    to document that a function does not pass exceptions.

  - Function contracts (cf. doc/CHANGES)
