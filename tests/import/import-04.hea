-- test for importing and modules

-- ignore-green-04 imports ignore-green-04b which declares MyNumber
-- **outside** of its module definition.  The imported MyNumber declaration
-- is therefore visible here.  The symbol "MyString" is however exported to
-- 'outer' only in green-04b and therefore not visibile here.
