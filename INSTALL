Requirements

  for the code itself:
    - c++ (tested with gcc 4.0.1)

  for building and testing:
  - a shell (posix compliant shell)
  - sed
  - GNU make (tested with GNU make 3.81)
  - python (tested with python 2.5.1)


  for the documentation:
  - texinfo (the makefile refers to texi2pdf and makeinfo)


Developed on Mac OS X (10.5), Linux, and Windows XP.


Build on Windows XP:

  - only tested with mingw32.  You need at least version
    mingw-get-inst-20100909, i.e. gcc 4.5.0.  gcc 4.4.0 shows some strange
    inconsistency in the default c++ library setup.
