Requirements

  for the code itself:
    - c++ (tested with gcc 4.0.1 on Mac OS X, 4.5.0 on mingw/linux)
    - llvm >=2.8 (http://www.llvm.org)

  for building and testing:
  - a shell (posix compliant shell)
  - sed
  - GNU make (tested with GNU make 3.81)
  - python (tested with python 2.5.1)


  for the documentation:
  - texinfo (the makefile refers to texi2pdf and makeinfo)


Developed on Mac OS X (10.5), Linux, and Windows XP.


Build on Mac OS X:

  1. build llvm (e.g. in ~/tmp/llvm-build)

    $ mkdir $TMP_DIR/llvm-build
    $ cd $TMP_DIR/llvm-build
    $ $LLVM_SRC_ROOT/configure
    $ make

  2. create a link to the build directory in $HERSCHEL_DIR/external:

    $ ln -s $TMP_DIR/llvm-build $HERSCHEL_ROOT/external/llvm

  3. review the settings in $HERSCHEL_ROOT/config.mk; probably create a
     config-local.mk and overwrite settings

  4. go to $HERSCHEL_ROOT and type 'make'

    $ make

     This should build the compiler, runtime libraries, prepare the
     documentation, and runs all available tests.  If everything went
     smooth you can find the created tools and documentation in the 'temp'
     folder.


Build on Windows XP:

  - only tested with mingw32.  You need at least version
    mingw-get-inst-20100909, i.e. gcc 4.5.0.  gcc 4.4.0 shows some strange
    inconsistency in the default c++ library setup.
