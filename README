What's it

  Herschel is an general-purpose multiparadigm programming language.  It is
  strongly typed, offering type inference and parametric polymorphism
  ("generics").  It is thoroughly object oriented (everything is a object),
  while its consequent multiple dispatch approach gives it a strong
  functional touch.  The object model is class-oriented, supporting
  multiple inheritance just as a separation of types ("protocols",
  "interfaces") and classes.

  A (non complete) list of features:

  - object oriented ("everything's an object")
  - multi dispatch functions
  - first class functions
  - fully lexical scoped
  - strong functional aproach (while being not strictly functional)
  - garbage collected
  - returnable exceptions
  - compiled, though not required by specification
