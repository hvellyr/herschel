What's it

  Heather is general purpose programming language aiming to be easy to use,
  clear in semantics and syntax, but powerful enough to be used for
  ambitious projects.

  A list of features:

  - object oriented ("everything's an object")
  - multi dispatch functions
  - first class functions, classes
  - fully lexical scoped
  - strong functional aproach (while being not fully functional)
  - garbage collected
  - returnable exceptions
  - compiled, though not required by specification

  - scheme
  - dylan
