Lazy evaluation
---------------

  The typical log problem.  The string is created before we decide whether
  we should log.  Either use macros:

    def macro log
    {
      { log(?level:expr, ?msg:expr) } -> { if (should-log(?level))
                                             log-impl(?msg)
                                         }
    }

  Or support lazy evaluation.  Since we will have the notion of "promises"
  anyway (for spawn and synchronization), this can be made first class:

    def log(level : Keyword, lazy msg : String)
      if (should-log(level))
        do-whatever-is-necessary(msg)

  Technically this can be done by the compiler as such.  The following
  example:

    log(#debug, StringBuffer().append("error ")
                              .append(exc.to-string)
                              .append("(").append(exc.details).append(")")
                              .to-string)

  can be compiled as:

    log(#debug, {
                  let msg = nil

                  function() : String {
                    if (msg.nil?)
                      msg = StringBuffer().append("error ")
                                          .append(exc.to-string)
                                          .append("(").append(exc.details).append(")")
                                          .to-string
                    msg
                  }
                })

  The log-implementation would look like:

    def log(level : Keyword, lazy msg : String)
      if (should-log(level))
        do-whatever-is-necessary(msg())


  Some better notation for this.  Lazy evaluation is probably important
  enough to have "real" syntax for it.  Some ideas:

    def log(level : Keyword, lazy msg : String) ...
    def log(level : Keyword, &lazy msg : String) ...

  Is being lazy a quality of the variable 'msg'?  or of the type?  Since
  being lazy and a reference is semantically strange we can declare them
  mutual exclusive and use the same prefix notation space for this:

    def log(level : Keyword, msg : String) ...      -- call by value
    def log(level : Keyword, msg : ^String) ...     -- call by reference
    def log(level : Keyword, msg : ,String) ...     -- call by lazy value (1)
    def log(level : Keyword, msg : *(String)) ...   -- call by lazy value (2)
    def log(level : Keyword, msg : (*)String) ...   -- call by lazy value (3)
    def log(level : Keyword, msg : =>String) ...    -- call by lazy value (4)



Function contracts
------------------

  Functions can be annotated by pre and post conditions.  These are
  actually part of the function signature and can be specified for abstract
  functions only.  Specialization must at least fulfill these contracts:

    def generic register-foo(reg @ Registry, foo @ 'T) : Registry
        where T isa Copyable
        on in foo <> nil
        on out(r) reg.key?(foo.name) and r == reg
     reg.put(foo.name, foo)
     reg

  These "on in" and "on out" statements are evaluated on entrance and exit
  of the function resp.  Only if both evaluate to true the contract is
  fulfilled, otherwise and AssertException is thrown.

  The "on out" statement is run after an "on exit" statement, where the
  function body's return value is passed in as 'r'.

  Another way to put pre and post conditions to functions is to declare an
  "on assert" statement in a class.  Such class invariants are run if a
  class instance is passed to the "assert" function:

    def class Date(d : Int, h : Int)
    {
      def slot day : Int = d
      def slot hour : Int = h

      on assert (c) {
        assert(1 <= day and <= 31)
        assert(0 <= hour and hour < 24)
      }
    }

    def generic add-day(date @ Date, day : Int) : Date
        on in assert(date)
        on out(r) r <> date and assert(r)
      Date(date.day + day, date.hour)

  The "on assert" statement is automatically called as last command from
  the class constructor, i.e. even after an "on init" statement.

  Pre and post conditions are normally not compiled in release versions.


Accessing slots
---------------

Slot access using the slot() and slot!() function doesn't seem to be the
right approach.  Esp.: how can we make this type safe?  There's no way to
bind the slot() function's type to the slot definition.

  def class Xi
  {
    def slot name : String
  }

  let t : Xi


So how to access and assign slots to 't' now?

  t.slot(#name)
  t.slot(#name) = "N.N."

  => problem is that this tedious to type, not really nice, and is
     difficult to do type safe if slot() is really treated as a function.

An abbreviated form?:

  t[name]
  t[name] = "N.N."

  => Problem is that this is not distinguishable from array access.


So I guess we need a special access syntax?  One which is hopefully usefull
for a struct extension later, too.  What's about this:

   t^name
   t^name = "N.N."

(In text books the '^' should be printed as a proper arrow up.)  Since the
^ is between an expression ('t') and a symbol ('name'), it can't be
confused with the reference syntax.



Rethink referencable types
--------------------------

This complete idea about pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference is somewhat
strange.  Most likely it will result in lot's of bugs (e.g. you expect to
modify the passed value, where you actually modify a copy of it, since you
forgot the ^ on the type declaration...).  So what we really need is the
const/immutable thing.

All values passed to functions are by default const.  If a parameter is to
be modifiable it is to be declared as 'var':

  def foo(var a : Int) var : Int

- you can't modify slots on const parameters

- you can't assign values to const parameters (like you can't do with const
  variables)

- you can't pass constant values to functions which take a variable value

- you can't return constant values from functions which has a variable
  return value

Less obscur syntax for union types
----------------------------------

Instead of &(String, Eof) use (String or Eof)

   def alias StringOrEof = (String or Eof)
