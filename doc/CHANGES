Visibility, export

  - Review module vs. interface again.
    Why do we need the "interface" specification?

  - What does "exporting" mean?  What does "public", "protected", "final"
    mean?

  - import outside or inside of "module" scope and effects on visibility


  Basic findings:

  - definitions from the embedding file are not visible in the embedded
    file.  I.e. embedded files are closures against the embedding context,
    they include their embedded files however.  I.e. also that exporting
    works always upwards (i.e. to the embedding context, not to the
    embedded context).

  - files imported inside a module scope are never visible to the outside of
    the module scope, even with exports in effect.  This is the way to
    encapsulate "private" imports from polluting public interface space.

  - importing into a module scope does not affect the overall namespace or
    module scope of the imported definitions; importing is about visibility
    not about inclusion.  For example import a module "b" inside of module
    "a" does not result in definitions of effective module scope "a.b", but
    only in definitions of module "b" being visible in module "a", without
    a file "c" necessarily deal with "b" definitions when importing "a".

  - exports are used to make definitions from inside the module scope
    visible to the outside.

    public -> import to all
    protected -> import to outer modules (if any, otherwise an error)
    private -> ?

    export public(...)
    export outer(...)
    export inner(...)

      Makes the listed symbols (or all if *) visible to the outer or inner
      scope of the module, resp.  The outer/inner scopes are defined as in
      the following chart:

      |   | | |module m22                      | | |

      Definitions of "m11" are not visible to anybody unless exported
      (simply as export (*), for instance).  The same applies to m21-m2,
      m211-m21, and m22-m2.  m211 is not visible to m2 however.  m22 is not
      visible to m21, to m211, to m11, or to m1, neither is m2 visible to
      m1.

      To make definitions visible to sibling modules (and their submodules)
      only export to "inner" (the inner circle of relations).  To make
      definitions visible to all modules up to the file (compile unit
      level) export to "outer" (the outer circle).  To make definitions
      visible to all export to "public".


  - files imported behave by definition as "interface", i.e. included
    implementations are **not** part of the importing compile unit.  Only
    the definitions of the imported file are actually imported.  (Note:
    macros are imported as "code", however, since macros are evaluated
    directly.  The same applies for char name and config variable
    definitions.)

    In this way we don't really need the "interface" keyword, since a
    module behaves silently as interface if imported.  The compiler must
    make sure however that two type/class definitions match if coming from
    **interface** (i.e. imported) and module definition.  The rule is than
    that if the compiler finds a symbol redefinition only must come from a
    compile unit, all others must origin from imported files.  The
    interface version may be reduced however (no "on init", no "on delete",
    not slot init values, only abstract generic functions, etc.).

  - exporting as "final" declares a symbol to be not extensible.  It can be
    combined with any of the visible keywords:

      export public (init) as final

    Definitions from a submodule can be exported as final to enclosing
    modules without changing visibility like this:

      export (init) as final


Slot definitions

  we need

  - control accessor/mutator function generation
  - slots should be annotatable ('transient')
  - why is a slot defined without `def' keyword?


  Annotating style:

    def slot name : String = _name ; transient, readonly

  Modifier style:

    def slot transient readonly name : String = _name


  def class PairIterator<T, Accessor<T> >(_root, acc)
      : Iterator<T>
  {
    public slot current : Pair<T, _> = _root
    private slot accessor : Accessor = acc
    transient readonly slot maxcount : Int = 4000 : Int
  }


  def class PairIterator<T, Accessor<T> >(_root, acc)
      : Iterator<T>
  {
    slot public current : Pair<T, _> = _root
    slot private accessor : Accessor = acc
    slot transient readonly maxcount : Int = 4000 : Int
  }


  def class PairIterator<T, Accessor<T> >(_root, acc)
      : Iterator<T>
  {
    def slot current : Pair<T, _> = _root ; public
    def slot accessor : Accessor = acc ; private
    def slot maxcount : Int = 4000 : Int ; transient, readonly
  }


  def class PairIterator<T, Accessor<T> >(_root, acc)
      : Iterator<T>
  {
    slot current : Pair<T, _> = _root ; public
    slot accessor : Accessor = acc ; private
    slot maxcount : Int = 4000 : Int ; transient, readonly
  }


  def class PairIterator<T, Accessor<T> >(_root, acc)
      : Iterator<T>
  {
    slot current : Pair<T, _> = _root :: public
    slot accessor : Accessor = acc :: private
    slot maxcount : Int = 4000 : Int :: transient, readonly
  }







Visibility and finalization for modules.

  Toplevel modules are always visible to the public.  Unless any class or
  methods is export however this information is worthless.  Every
  identifier must be exported to the public or protected domain, either
  final or open.

  The same applies to nested (i.e. inner) module:

  def module printer("sijo/ixwick:printer") {
    -- exporting the inner module:
    export final public(printer-driver, DriverSettings)

    def class DriverSettings() { ... {

    def module printer-driver("sijo/ixwick:printer-driver") {
      export public (init-driver, get-driver-settings)

      def generic init-driver() ...
      def generic get-driver-settings() : DriverSettings ...
    }
  }

  Identifier from inner modules are seen by direct parent modules; if
  protected they are seen by all ancestor modules until the top-module; if
  public they are seen by all modules in the top-level module even in
  siblings.  Symbols from inner modules must be explictely exported to the
  outside from the top-level module if this is required:

    def module printer("sijo/ixwick:printer") {
      export final public(printer-driver|get-driver-settings, DriverSettings)

    }




Lazy evaluation

  The typical log problem.  The string is created before we decide whether
  we should log.  Either use macros:

    def macro log
    {
      { log(?level:expr, ?msg:expr) } -> { if (should-log(?level))
                                             log-impl(?msg)
                                         }
    }

  Or support lazy evaluation.  Since we will have the notion of "promises"
  anyway (for spawn and synchronization), this can be made first class:

    def log(level : Keyword, lazy msg : String)
      if (should-log(level))
        do-whatever-is-necessary(msg)

  Technically this can be done by the compiler as such.  The following
  example:

    log(#debug, StringBuffer().append("error ")
                              .append(exc.to-string)
                              .append("(").append(exc.details).append(")")
                              .to-string)

  can be compile as:

    log(#debug, function() : String {
                  StringBuffer().append("error ")
                                .append(exc.to-string)
                                .append("(").append(exc.details).append(")")
                                .to-string
                })

  The log-implementation would look like:

    def log(level : Keyword, lazy msg : String)
      if (should-log(level))
        do-whatever-is-necessary(msg())



Embedding C and C++ fragments.

  In the C extern it is only allowed to embed function definitions.  In the
  C++ embed it is possible also to embed class definitions ... but no code.

  extern ("C") {
    size_t fprintf(FILE* stream, const char* format, ...);
  }

  extern ("C++") {
    ...
  }
